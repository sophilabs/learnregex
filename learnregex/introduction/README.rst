Regular expressions (or regex for short) are a little programming language
that comes embedded in many systems, applications and even other programming
languages as Python. Unlike most programming languages, regular expressions
have a particular and limited scope: matching strings.

In Python, regular expressions are provided by the `re` module. Be sure to use
it in every adventure and keep its documentation_ at hand so you know how to
do so.

.. _documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html

For this first adventure, write a python function that receives a string and
returns True if it contains the substring 'Python', and False otherwise.

You can use this template to get started:

.. sourcecode:: python

    import re

    def test(string):
        # Your code goes here

When you are done, you must run:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ {script} verify program.py

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the
lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
